Razak Faculty of Technology and Informatics Department proposes a software for vehicle driving which is controlled by “Safe-Drive” equipment. The CSCI identified for this system is called On-Board Automobile (OBA) computer software which is a control panel for the vehicle computer.

Purpose of the system:
----------------------
Within the framework of Wawasan 2020 the Malaysian Government wants to investigate the feasibility of a new car. After consultation with experts and discussion with its partners, the Razak Faculty of Technology and Informatics Department proposes the following system: - For vehicle driving, the system will be controlled by so-called “Safe Drive” equipment.

Basically, DAS will perform three main components of functionalities as follow:
•	A "safe driving" functionality
•	A tracking functionality
•	A mapping functionality

Purpose of On-Board Automobile CSCI:
------------------------------------
The software to be developed will improve the safety of vehicle driving, in particular over long trips on motorways. It will help to free the driver of certain routine actions and Inform the driver of certain problems detected in the driving of the vehicle. The software will also participate in the improvement of the vehicle’s operating safety.
